# Overview 

Module 11 of the Bootcamp course pertained to the topic of creating a webpage with JS and CSS programming languages paired with HTML5 markups. The goal is to test students' ability to interact with these languages and produce a functional webpage with interactive elements. 

The outcome is the creation is a page that allows users to search through a dataset of UFO encounters and filter by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO objects from a set of documented sightings.

* The webpage allows users to filter on certain data elements including date, city, state, country, and shape of UFOS. 

* The placeholder texts in these filter boxes are 1/10/2010, Houston, TX, US, and circle respectively

* To perform a filtered search, users need only click on the text boxes, input their filters, and click enter. The filter will be applied to the whole data set table

# Summary 

The final product is a functional webpage using HTML markup, css style scripts, and js programming languages to create interactive and trigger-based elements on an HTML page. The HTML page shows an inactive dataset with fixed data points and allows users to interact with the data by applying filters to it. 

In its current format, the final product is limited by the following: 

* lack of live data (IE: the dataset presented in the tables is not being updated with new datapoints) 
* limited user interactivity (IE: the only user interactivity currently present on the page is the user ability to filter the data on certain data elements) 
* limited scope of dataset elements (IE: the dataset primarily contains US based data points. It may be advisable to update with UFO sightings from other countries)
* lack of language options allowing users to toggle between English or other languages.

Of the identified faults to the webpage the most critical recommendations for improving the page are 1) the adaptation of live data to the HTML page and 2) the inclusion of a greater share of UFO sighting in the dataset tables from those reported in other countries outside the US.
